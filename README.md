**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Aaron Justin Reed**

Time spent: **4.75** hours spent in total

## User Stories
    The tipCalculator "Tip Solver" application allows its user to enter in an arbitrary bill amount and from
    this bill amount, the application solves the tip, displays this tip, and also sums the total (i.e. the
    individual bill before a tip and the tip value) together to display to the user how much money needs to be
    paid given their selected tip amount. 

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ check] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [check] UI animations //the color green added for enhanced aesthetic value to the application.
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    This was my first time using Swift and creating an iOS application of any kind. The main challenges I had
    were becoming familiar with firstly, the Swift language, and secondly, the Xcode platform. Learning about 
    storyboards, and the sequence of different controllers (e.g. view controllers and navigation controllers)
    also required some time to learn enough of to be able to complete the project functionally.
