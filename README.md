# Pre-work - *project name tipCalculator*
*Note: In the application itself, for a less generic name, the applicaiton is referred to as the "Tip Solver."

**tipCalculator** is a tip calculator application for the iOS.

Submitted by: **Aaron Justin Reed**

Time spent: **4.75** hours spent in total (time spent also looking into Settings optional feature)

## User Stories
    
    *The tipCalculator "Tip Solver" application allows its user to enter in an arbitrary bill amount and from
    this bill amount, the application solves the tip, displays this tip, and also sums the total (i.e. the
    individual bill before a tip and the tip value) together to display to the user how much money needs to be
    paid given their selected tip amount. 

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations //the color green added for enhanced aesthetic value to the application.
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    *The main challenges I had involved the time needed to learn about Swift and Xcode as a platform. I had zero experience with Swift and zero experience developing a mobile application using Xcode. 
    *Since Xcode is a robust platform, it was very interesting learning about the use of storyboards along with the sequence of different controllers (e.g. view controllers and navigation controllers). I took this recently learned information and applied it to creating a functional application which took some time to both learn and work through so that I made sure I understood what I was doing as opposed to only following directions. 
    *Time was also spent learning about how to add Settings to this iOS application to specify a default tip value as opposed to waiting for the user to explicitly select a tip value. In the future, I will be able to apply this knowledge to further enhancing iOS web applications.
